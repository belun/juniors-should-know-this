# Do not lie

Code should not be hard do read.

It should be expresive, in terms of class names, method names, field names, variable names, package names. 

With bad names, the reader will be either mislead or just have a hard time trying to understand what the code is supposed to do. 

A reader should not have to look inside a class / method / module to understand the basic functionality of a piece of code.
