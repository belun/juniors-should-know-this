# Goal

As a developer, you write text. Sure, the text represents computer instructions and the computer will take this code and do things according to it. 

Once the code is in good format and it can be understood and run by the computer \(will adere to a specific programming language syntax\), it is also supposed to do what the stakeholder paid for \(implement the desired business logic\).

#### But what about the developer? 

_Could the code help the maintainers in any way possible?_

The answer is _yes_ and this mini-series is presenting concepts that make working with source code easier.
