# Building abstractions

The ideas behind of an object-oriented language is to empower the developer to :

* build abstractions on top of abstractions : by putting small components \(low level concepts\) into bigger and bigger components
* connect abstractions in an easy manner : by hiding the internal details of the abstractions.
* connect the abstractions in an optimal way \(connect things in a way that makes reading and working with the code easy ; low coupling\) 

The techniques that come to the rescue are : encapsulation and polymorphism.
